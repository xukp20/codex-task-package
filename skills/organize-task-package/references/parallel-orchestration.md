## 1. Enablement

Parallel execution is off by default. Enable it only after user confirmation and only when the task has clear write lanes.

Do not parallelize these areas merely for speed:

- one persistence model and its migration;
- one registry, shared configuration, lockfile, or generated surface;
- one transaction, finalizer, or Release path;
- a shared design that remains open;
- a consumer that requires an unfinished provider API.

Run them serially or finish the provider first.

## 2. Orchestrator responsibilities

The current task acts as Orchestrator and:

- freezes parts, dependency graph, Worker/Reviewer pairing, and write scope;
- prepares worktrees/branches or shared-tree ownership;
- dispatches each Worker GOAL;
- receives blocker, pause, completion, and integration receipts;
- maintains root GOAL and coordination records;
- integrates reviewed outputs and runs integration validation;
- closes worktrees and branches.

By default, fork every Worker from one frozen planning boundary and fork its Reviewer before Worker execution. Fixed or fresh sessions are explicit overrides; see [session-topology.md](session-topology.md).

The Orchestrator normally has no active Goal and does not occupy an execution loop merely to wait. Respond to task messages or state receipts.

## 3. Lane definition

Each lane declares:

- Worker, Reviewer, requested models/reasoning, enforcement methods/status, and receipts;
- assigned work items;
- impact scope and exact write scope;
- shared hotspots and no-touch scope;
- provider/consumer dependencies;
- branch, worktree, and baseline;
- validation and delivery commit;
- pause gates, notification targets, and completion conditions;
- task IDs, session modes, fork sources, and pre-execution fork point.

No lane starts from a merely planned or confirmed model. Each Worker and Reviewer context must first have an `enforced` creation, handshake-plus-dispatch, current-task, or explicit-subagent receipt. Nested subagents need separate receipts; the lane task's configuration does not configure them implicitly.

Allow only one writer for a file or business object in one coordination window. Do not review a range while its Worker is still changing it.

## 4. Worktree choice

Prefer isolated worktrees when:

- multiple Workers write code;
- lanes need independent baselines or commits;
- the shared checkout contains other active changes;
- review needs exact branch state;
- merge order is part of the task.

A shared tree is acceptable only when project rules require it, write scopes are fully disjoint, shared files are frozen, and one integrator owns commits.

## 5. One-to-one review

Pair each parallel Worker with an independent Reviewer. One Reviewer may sequentially inspect unrelated lanes but may not review a range it implemented or integrated.

Each lane uses:

- `goals/<worker>.md`;
- `execution/<worker>.md`;
- `review/<reviewer>.md`.

Workers write only their lane records. The Orchestrator alone writes root GOAL and `coordination/**`.

## 6. Integration

A lane is ready only when:

- every work item is `approved`;
- the exact commit is recorded;
- its worktree is clean;
- no blocking finding remains;
- upstream dependency versions are explicit.

Integrate in dependency order. Conflict resolution is integration work owned by one integrator. Rerun focused validation affected by a conflict and re-review the new snapshot when necessary.

## 7. Cleanup

Clean a lane only when:

- its commit is integrated, or the user explicitly keeps an isolated branch;
- integration validation passes;
- the worktree is clean;
- evidence and sensitive configuration are archived according to policy;
- the user did not request preservation.

By default, remove integrated local task branches/worktrees and return to the original main branch. Never delete an unmerged, dirty, running, or still-reviewable worktree.
