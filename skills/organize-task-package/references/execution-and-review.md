# Worker Execution and Review

- State, commits, and notifications

## 1. Default roles

- Worker: `gpt-5.6-sol/high`.
- Reviewer mode: `inherited_subagent` by default; it inherits the Worker's model and reasoning.
- Explicit `self_review` creates no separate Reviewer and must not be described as independent.
- An independent Reviewer must not review code or artifacts it implemented or integrated.
- A requested model is not effective until the target creation, configuration handshake plus formal dispatch, current-task audit, or explicit subagent spawn has an enforcement receipt.
- If a requested configuration is unavailable, stop before execution and record `mismatch`; do not silently accept a fallback while claiming the request.

The Reviewer may be the read-only current task, a separate task, or a nested subagent. For a single Worker, default to a full-history Worker-managed subagent created after task/code reading but before active Goal creation, implementation reasoning, or product writes. `self_review` is available only when selected in the launch configuration.

Apply [session-topology.md](session-topology.md) before launch. Record how the selected topology excludes implementation context; a pre-execution fork is one valid construction, not the only one.

## 2. Worker launch gates

Before starting, the Worker must:

1. read project rules, all required package documents, and its assigned GOAL;
2. inspect coordination state, current HEAD, working tree, and write scope;
3. verify that every material design gate is closed;
4. verify that the validation matrix is frozen;
5. verify explicit user authorization and the absolute GOAL path, but do not create the active Goal until the Reviewer readiness gate below passes;
6. leave token budget unset unless the user specified one;
7. record Worker/Reviewer task or subagent IDs, session modes, sources, owners, and independence construction;
8. verify an `enforced` model/reasoning receipt for every assigned context;
9. apply the confirmed review mode: create the default full-history inherited Reviewer and record `READY_REVIEW`, or record `SELF_REVIEW_READY` without creating a subagent;
10. for independent review, verify that the Reviewer context excludes implementation reasoning for this batch;
11. only then create the Worker active Goal, record its ID in the technical receipt, and begin implementation.

## 3. Per-item execution receipts

Record at least:

- baseline commit, data version, runtime configuration, or evidence snapshot;
- actual modified or operated paths;
- implementation details and rationale;
- deviations from frozen design;
- added or changed tests and checks;
- exact commands, exit states, counts, and durations;
- failures, interruptions, timeouts, and retries;
- commit, artifact, checkpoint, or trace locator;
- residual risk;
- self-review conclusion.

Do not report interrupted or failed commands as passing. Broad tests supplement but do not replace focused negative evidence.

## 4. Reviewer inputs

A review request must identify:

- work-item ID;
- exact design location;
- execution-record location;
- exact commit, diff, artifact, or checkpoint;
- commands and results already run;
- known risks and untested scope;
- the only review document the Reviewer may modify.

The Reviewer must inspect the real implementation or artifact, not only the Worker summary or test names.

## 5. Review outputs

Append a record for every iteration containing:

- time, Reviewer identity, requested model/reasoning, enforcement receipt, and actual settings when observable;
- exact reviewed snapshot;
- design-conformance analysis;
- positive and negative validation quality;
- `P0/P1/P2/P3` findings;
- evidence, impact, recommended repair, and recommended validation for each finding;
- per-item `approved` or `rework_required` verdict;
- part-level integrated-audit verdict;
- uninspected scope and residual risk.

An inherited Reviewer is read-only for product files and writes only its review record. In `self_review`, the Worker writes a concise record covering exact snapshot, design/document coverage, validation, findings, residual risk, and `SELF` verdict.

## 6. State transitions

```text
pending
  -> Worker completes the item and records evidence
     -> implemented_pending_review
        -> selected review mode rework_required: remain in this state; Worker repairs
        -> selected review mode approved: Worker verifies REVIEW or SELF receipt and marks approved
```

Any later relevant implementation change invalidates the old approval. Return the item to `implemented_pending_review` and review the new exact snapshot.

## 7. Commit gates

Unless project policy says otherwise:

- use a reviewable commit for a coherent item or closed slice;
- keep every intermediate commit loadable and runnable;
- exclude unrelated changes;
- review an exact commit or explicitly identified staged diff;
- inspect sensitive files, process-document commit rules, generated artifacts, and the working tree before final commit;
- do not modify or commit code when the user requested review only.

## 8. Notifications

- A dispatched Worker notifies the parent task when blocked, when a design decision is needed, when review is ready, and when work completes.
- A Worker operating directly in the current user task reports normally and does not notify itself.
- A Reviewer notifies the Worker or Orchestrator with the review-record path and exact verdict.
